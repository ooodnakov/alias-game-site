# Deck migration checklist

Generated by scripts/starter-kit/generate.mjs

## Normalise deck structure

Export your existing words to JSON and run them through the starter kit schema to make sure fields like `language`, `allowNSFW`, and `metadata` are set.

## Audit difficulty and categories

Use the helper spreadsheet or your own notes to tag each word with a difficulty from 0–10 plus any category or part of speech you want surfaced in search.

## Generate cover art

Drop your deck title into the SVG templates and export a 1080×1080 PNG so the gallery shows a consistent thumbnail.

## Validate before upload

Drag the JSON into `/decks/upload` and confirm the preview renders. Fix any validation errors before submitting to moderation.

## Test the in-app import

Open the Android app, paste the JSON URL, and run a quick round to verify timers, categories, and NSFW toggles behave as expected.
